# InstructlabYamlGenerator

## Overview
If you are new to YAML, this simple webapp will help you creating your first YAML file for [InstructLab](https://github.com/instructlab). YAML is notoriously strict when it come to indentation so this just starts you on your YAML journey!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.

## TODOs / Known Issues

- Dockerfile 
- init NG-Components with current state so that it will be possible to navigate back as well and keep the data
- migrate the gloval scss to component based scss
- subscribe/unsubscribe

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
